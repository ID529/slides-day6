In this activity, you're being asked to identify a particular topic that interests you, search the internet, and find a few resources that you think might help you understand the topic further. 

You might want to choose a topic that matches well with your final presentation topic, or you can choose to do an altogether different topic. 

Resources that you might find could be chapters from online books, StackOverflow or stackexchange threads, threads from community.rstudio.com, etc., the help pages built into R, or the [CRAN Task Views](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/).

Some interesting topics that you might want to look into: 

  * How can you work with big data in R? 
  * How can you perform bootstrapping [or another particular statistical method] in R? 
  * How can you use R to work on a computing cluster like Harvard's Odyssey?
  * Pick a data visualization and try to figure out how you can replicate it.
    * You might look at some examples of figures by Cedric Schrerer or Georgios Karamanis

We're asking you to respond to the following questions: 

  * What vocabulary or code commands that appeared in the references you found was new to you? 
  * Were there certain keywords or strategies that were helpful in your search? Sometimes it's useful to include "rstats" instead of "r" since "r" can match on a lot of irrelevant material. 
  * Do you have remaining questions? What are they? If so, what do you think would be necessary to include to post your question(s) to StackOverflow? 
  * Do you trust the information you found?  Does it seem up to date?
